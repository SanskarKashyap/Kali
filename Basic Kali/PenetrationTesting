step of Penetration Testing 

1 prepare for the test -- > written permission 
2 Constract a plan --> tool tyarr karna
3 Build a team --> 2-3 log
4 Gather information --> target ke bare me jankari jutana
5 Identify vulnerabilities --> vulnurability ko find karna
6 Exploit vulnerabilities --> vulnurability ko use karna
7 Report findings --> report banana
8 Remediate --> vulnurability ko fix karna
9 Verify remediation --> vulnurability ko check karna
10 Report --> report banana


Diffrence between VAPT ant PT

Scope: VAPT has a broder scope than PT
VAPT include both Vulnarability Assessment and Penetration Testing {where Valnarability Assessment can be done with automation tools }
PT is done manually and it is more focused on finding the vulnerabilities and exploiting them



Types of PT

Black Box Testing - It start with zero knowledge of the target's technology infrastructure and it is more like a real world attack , the 
                    goal of this test is to quickly identify easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities and misconfiguration
                    It is also known as blind testing

Grey Box Testing - takes a step further than black box testing , it start with partial knowledge of the target's technology infrastructure and sequrity measures 
                    the goal of this testing is to learn details about vuln that can be exploted to a greater level then Black box testing 
                    It is also known as partial testing

White Box Testing - it is the most advanced type of testing , it start with full knowledge of the target's technology infrastructure. White box tester are
                    typically the most esperienced and skilled testers 
                    the goal of this inprove an organization's sequrity posture 


External Test - it is done from outside the organization's network , it is also known as remote testing , without organtisation's knowledge
                the goal of this test is to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by external attackers

Internal Test - it aims to expose what damage could be done if an attacker is already inside the organisation's network , it is also known as on-site testing
                the goal of this test is to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious insiders  
                {employees who arer likely to respond to social engineering or phishing attacks}

Blind Test - in this test , tester is permited (onganisation knows about tha attack before hand(when,where)) , and all publicaly information is provided to the 
            tester the goal of this test is to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by external attackers. 
            Tester must use all their skills to find the vulnerabilities  


Tips to become good Pen Tester 

keep youself updated 
practice Daily 
participate in CTFs and hackathons
Talk with experts , pentester , attend conferences , meetups
