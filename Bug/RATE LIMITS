RATE LIMITS
To keep the challenges available to as many people as possible we have a strict limit on the amount of web requests you can perform per second, which is currently set to 10 requests per second. If you go over this amount then you'll receive a rate limit error message with a HTTP Status Code of 429.

The below example shows how you can apply rate limits to the ffuf tool using the -t and -p switches ( 1 thread and pause for 0.1 seconds between requests )

ffuf -w ~/wordlists/contents.txt -t 1 -p 0.1 -H "Cookie: ctfchallenge=eyJkYXRhIjoiZXlKMWMyVnlYMmhoYzJnaU9pSnpPRzV3ZG1VMGFpSXNJbkJ5WlcxcGRXMGlPbVpoYkhObGZRPT0iLCJ2ZXJpZnkiOiJmMmZlZjI5MWI5ZjJlNWE1YjRkMjBjZTgwNzRlZTY1ZCJ9" http://challenge.test/FUZZ
