# tuple is just like list but immutable means you can't change it once it created 
# it can be used for security purpose

# tuple is created by using () brackets

print(S_No.index(7)) # return the index of 1 in S_No

print(S_No.__sizeof__()) # return the size of S_No

print(type(S_No)) # return the type of S_No
