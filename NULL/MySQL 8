 MySQL 8 
 uses a new authentication based on improved SHA256-based password methods. It is recommended that all new MySQL Server installations use this method going forward. This new authentication plugin requires new versions of connectors and  clients, with support for this new authentication method  (caching_sha2_password). Currently MySQL 8 Connectors and   community drivers built with libmysqlclient21 support this new method. Clients built with older versions of libmysqlclient    
 may not be able to connect to the new server. 

 To retain compatibility with older client software, the default authentication plugin can be set to the legacy value 
 (mysql_native_password) This should only be done if required third-party software has not been updated to work with the new authentication method. The change will be written to the file 
 /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/default-auth-override.cnf

 After installation, the default can be changed by setting the default_authentication_plugin server setting.
