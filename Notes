OSI modle - 7 layers - {application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, physical}
TCP/IP - 4-5 layers - {application, transport, network, data link, physical }

Q1 How TCP works ?
 Total 6 Flags work in TCP 
    1. SYN syncronization
    2. ACK acknowledgement
    3. FIN finish
    4. RST reset - reset the connection
    5. PSH push - send all the buffer data immidetely 
    6. URG urgent - data contained in this packet is processed urgently 


Domain Name 
    * ip Name
    * easy to remember

DNS - Domain Name System
    * DNS server - convert domain name to ip address
    * DNS server - convert ip address to domain name

Zone Files -it is a text file that contains DNS records , do Ip mapping  {DNS server use this file to resolve domain name to ip address}
    * A - ip address of domain name
    * CNAME - alias of domain name / forward domain or subdomain to another domain 
    * MX - direct mail to mail server
    * NS - name server
    * PTR - reverse of A record {reverse lookup}
    * SOA - start of authority /  email, serial number, refresh, retry, expire, minimum TTL ,, (Domain's Admin info are stored here)
    * TXT - any DNS text record entered by ADMIN 
    * AAAA - ipv6 address
    * SRV - service location record {specify hostname and port number of servers for specified services}

Types of Request Method 
    * GET -data transfder through URL , easily visible and not secure 
    * HEAD - same as get but without body, trsnfer status line and header only
    * POST - send user information through body , not visible and secure in HTML format 
    * PUT - update data to server
    * DELETE - delete data from server
    * OPTIONS - describe the communication options for the target resource
    * TRACE - get diagnostic information from server {message loop back along the path to the client}
    * CONNECT - establish tunnel to server



Use of Ethical Hacking 
    * system Hardening - make system secure
    *network security - make network secure {firewall, IDS, IPS, VPN} , if data breach in network then system Hardening is of no use 
    * Defeat Hackers - find vulnerability and fix it before hacker find it {healthy ego :D} 
    *increase cyber sequitiy  
    *Digital Wellbieing - so that comman people can feel safe that system is working properly and no one is trying to hack it
